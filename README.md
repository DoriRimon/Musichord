## Chord Search
Chord Search allows you to translate a chord's name to its shape on your instrument (Usually a chord has 
multiple ways to be played on an instrument, therfore you can see all the possible ways to play the chord).

## Chord Namer
Chord Namer allows you to translate a chord's shape to it's name. <br><br>

## Side Notes
The app is in building process, which means some of the features (including Chord Search, and smaller features
like settings) are yet to be made, or still under construction. <br><br>
